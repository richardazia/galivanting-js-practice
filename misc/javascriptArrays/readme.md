Some and every example

Using words and the code equivalent

const temps are 90, 88, 85, 92, 84 and 99

- are some temps lower than 90 degrees? Yes, three temps are lower. 
- Is every temperature over 80 degrees?	We see that the range of temperatures is from 80 to 90 so this is also correct. 

The code equivalent const some = temps.some(e => e <90 ) = TRUE!
const every = temps.every(e => e > 80) = TRUE!
