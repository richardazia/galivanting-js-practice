#JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

## Big O Notation

- Big O is about determining which approach is best. 

- Use pricse words about what the code should do
- define the strengths and weaknesses of solutions
- refine the solution over time, to make it more efficient, and less prone to crashing. (bottle necks etc). 
- often comes up in interviews

### What makes it better? 

- speed
- less resource intensive, less memory
- easier to understand

### Timing
- can be different between machines
- can be different between executions
- may not be fast enough to measure what needs to be measured

- instead of counting time we can count the number of operations required to get a result

We count the operations as multiplication, adding, division and more. We count the times when a computer has to do something. 

In the simple solution there are 3 steps. In the complex solution there are n operations. 

As a list we have
- n additions
- n assignments
- 1 assignment
- n comparisons
- n additions
- n additions
- 1 assignment

So in theory n + n + 1 + n + n + n + 1. At the simplest it will take seven operations to get a result.

So what looks like a simple operation to us, when broken down into tasks or steps becomes a much bigger task. 

Think of automating a task rather than doing it manually, like filling a log sheet. 

Big O formalises fuzzy counting. 

It formalises how we evaluate algorithm runtime as data size increases. 

It focuses on broad trends.

Definition: "We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is ecentually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases."

f(n) can be: 
- linear
- quadratic
- constant
- something else

Big O shorthands

1. Arithmetic operations are constant
2. Variables are also constant
3. Accessing array elements is constant (by index or object key). 
4. With a loop it depends on the complexity of the loop. 

## Space Complexity

"How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm".

additional term: Auxiliary space complexity 

### Rules of thumb

- Primitives are constant space
- Strings: require O(n) space - n = string length
- Reference types O(n), n is the length of the array or the number of object keys. 

"The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divive that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one. 

To consider

- certain search algorithms have logarithmic complexity
- efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms
recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity. 

Summary

- Big O helps is analyse performance
- Big O noation provides a high angle overview of algorithm time and space requirements
- Looks at the big picture, not the details
- device agnostic. 



0(1) is constant time (push and pop)
0(n) is linear time (shift, unshift, concat, slice, splice, forEach, map, filter, reduce etc)
0(N * log N) - there are seven of them. (sort)

## Problem Solving Approach
- Define Algorithms
A process or set of steps to accomplich a certain task

Ride a bike: Find a bike, make sure it has wheels, make sure the tires are inflated. Pedal forward faster than you fall over sideways, keep going etc. 

"It is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer."

- Plan how to solve algorithms

Think back to the Rescue diver course

1. Devise a plan for solving problems

2. Master common problem solving patterns
	- Understand the problem
	- Explore concrete examples
	- break it down
	- solve/simplify the problem (I think a better step could be defined here)
	- review and refactor


- evaluate different approaches
