#JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

## Big O Notation

- Big O is about determining which approach is best. 

- Use pricse words about what the code should do
- define the strengths and weaknesses of solutions
- refine the solution over time, to make it more efficient, and less prone to crashing. (bottle necks etc). 
- often comes up in interviews
