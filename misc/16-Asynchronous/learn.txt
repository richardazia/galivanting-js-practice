Learning Vim

I am learning to use vim

i for insert mode

:qa! to quit instantly

esc to escape from i

The trick to learning is enjoying

to write a new file write :w filename.txt

To change file we write :e filename.txt

ctrl g to see which file is being edited

:wq and enter to quit

w to go to the next word

e to move to the end of a word

4 w would move you forward by four words. 

Use braces to  move to the next sentence or previous one. This is to see how it works. I think it works. 

use { } to move between paragraphs

To move around we would use 3 } to move forward by three paragraphs
To move back two sentences we would write 2
3w to reach the third word.

To search /tra to search for words starting with tra like training. 

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Press n to see the next word

Use question mark to search backwards through text.

The word is in England for challenge search word

Shift g to move to the end of the file
press gg: "g" twice.

ctrl + f to move forward, one screen at a time. 

ctrl b to move backwards by one screen at a time

ctrl + f to move forward, one screen at a time. 

ctrl b to move backwards by one screen at a time.

We can search for an error by typing 8 for line 8

We can also use 8 and shift g


We can search for an error by typing 8 for line 8

We can also use 8 and shift g

vim hello.go +8 to open a file at a specific line number. 

The word is woman

3j 6w to move down three lines down and six words across

Use n until you find the repeat word you are looking for.
